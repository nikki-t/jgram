MAIN ENTRY POINT:
MainJGRAM.main

DESCRIPTION:
This iteration of JGRAM is focused on providing exception handling for
input and Word document validation and file I/O operations.

Exception handling is demonstrated in each Task subclass' concrete 
implementation of the performTask method. All exceptions are generated by
the detection of invalid data in the various objects used by each task. All 
exceptions are handled by the appropriate Task class.

File I/O is handled as Word document input to JGRAM. Word document assignments
are graded and copies of graded assignments are outputted to a 'GRADED' sub-
directory and prepended with the title 'GRADED'. A tamper detection reported
is also outputted for all assignments tested for modifications.
