MAIN ENTRY POINT:
MainJGRAM.main

DESCRIPTION:
This iteration of JGRAM is focused on the use of generics. A Linked List data 
structure has been created and customized to the needs of JGRAM. The LinkedList 
class uses generics to store the different objects used by JGRAM to evaluate 
grade data. The LinkedList class supports only the operations required by JGRAM,
which include adding elements to the end of the list, checking if the list is 
empty, and support for the enhanced for loop via the implementation of the 
Iterator and Iterable interfaces.
