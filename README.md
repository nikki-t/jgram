# JGRAM

## Project Overview
Just in Time Grading Messages (JGRAM) is a program conceived of by Professor Braude at Boston University Metropolitan College to better connect strades. The goaludents with learning objectives and assignment g of the program is to provide assignment feedback through the use of checkpoints located in key points throughout the assignment. Along with the inclusion of feedback, each checkpoint has a weight and grade. JGRAM produces a results table that collocates all checkpoints in one place which provides an overview of the studentâ€™s grade. The checkpoints help students to understand how they met expectations of the assignment and where to focus their future work in the course.
