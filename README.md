# JGRAM

## Project Overview
Just in Time Grading Messages (JGRAM) is a program conceived of by Professor Braude at Boston University Metropolitan College to better connect strades. The goaludents with learning objectives and assignment g of the program is to provide assignment feedback through the use of checkpoints located in key points throughout the assignment. Along with the inclusion of feedback, each checkpoint has a weight and grade. JGRAM produces a results table that collocates all checkpoints in one place which provides an overview of the student’s grade. The checkpoints help students to understand how they met expectations of the assignment and where to focus their future work in the course.

Students complete assignments and submit them as Word documents through a Content Management System. The instructor then downloads the assignments and inserts checkpoints as comments into each assignment. The instructor also inserts a grade mapping which is used to map letter grades to integer values (e.g., A+=97) as a comment into the assignment. After the instructor has inserted the appropriate comments, the instructor runs the JGRAM program to calculate the total grades for each student’s assignment. The program uses the checkpoints’ grades and weights to determine the total grade. The program outputs a copy of the assignment with a results table appended to the end of the document. The results table contains each checkpoint’s weight, grade, and feedback. The table also includes the final grade for the assignment. The assignments can then be uploaded to the Content Management System for students to review. JGRAM also provides tamper detection to determine if previously graded assignments’ checkpoints have been altered in any way.
